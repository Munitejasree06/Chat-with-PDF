# OverviewðŸ¤–
This application allows you to chat with your PDF documents locally. It's built using a combination of advanced technologies to provide a seamless and interactive experience.
# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach that combines the power of retrieval-based methods and generation-based models to enhance the quality and accuracy of language generation tasks. It involves retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of documents or databases before generating responses, leading to more informed and contextually accurate outputs.
## Workflow

**Input**: RAG takes multiple pdf as input.
**VectoreStore**: The pdf's are then converted to vectorstore using FAISS and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Embeddings model from Hugging Face.
**Memory**: Conversation buffer memory is used to maintain a track of previous conversation which are fed to the llm model along with the user query.
Text Generation with GPT-3.5 Turbo: The embedded input is fed to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from the OpenAI API, which produces the final output.
User Interface: Streamlit is used to create the interface for the application.
